# Gekota
Gekota is a simple program written by JavaScript, which can convert PAM file to visual Flash animation, for Plants vs. Zombies 2.

Here is a [video demonstration](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ya4y1Y7qz) for Gekota in Bilibili. From this video, you can get an overview of how to use it.

Gekota is the continuation of [ReadPam](https://github.com/jiangnangame/ReadPam), which decode binary PAM file to readable JSON file. Both ReadPam and Gekota are created in 2020 when I was a freshman in high school. With an unprecedented epidemic, being free from going to school every day, I had some spare time to explore the way to decode Popcap's animation file format.

# Contribute

Obviously, Gekota obviously was a immature project, because I just wanted to prove my programming skills through developing it. What's more, facing intense academic stress, I had no more time to perfect it then. 

Now I upload some fail examples on Github, if you are interesting at it, you can try to improve Gekota so that it could correctly processes these examples.

Everyone is welcome to make Gekota better!
